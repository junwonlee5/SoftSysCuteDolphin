# Digital Signal Processing in C

## Team Members
Junwon Lee

## Goals

The goal of this project is to create functions in C that are necessary for signal processing, such as convolution and DTFT (Discrete Time Fourier Transform).

The lower bound goal is to create a convolution function and DTFT function. Ideally, the convolution function would take input signal and system function as inputs. The function would convolve these two inputs and return the output signal that can be saved as a new audio file. The DTFT function would take the input signal and output the DTFT of the signal.

If I am successful in achieving this goal, my stretch goal is to apply the functions I use for audio signal processing projects, such as bass line detection and chord recognition.

## Learning Goals

### Becoming Familiar with writing C code
I am not comfortable writing C code. I hope that by writing these basic signal processing functions I hope to improve my C code writing experience.

### Learning connection between writing C code and signal processing.
I am familiar with and very interested in studying signal processing, and I am very curious about how similar the mathematical concepts in signal processing are relevant to writing efficient code for signal processing functions. For example, I could learn how C can make the calculations more efficient.  

## Things I Need to Get started
I need to know if there are any preexisting DSP libraries available. I will find them through googling.

## First Steps

### Step 1: Review discrete time convolution and DTFT
**People:** Junwon
**Definition of Done:** Review how discrete time convolution and DTFT work mathematically and think about how to translate these operations in C.

### Step 2: Start writing the functions & Look for pre-existing libraries

**People:** Junwon
**Definition of Done:** Create 1D convolution & DTFT functions and test them with basic functions (impulse, step function, periodic functions, etc). Also, look for pre-existing libraries that may simplify creating functions or testing them.

### Step 3: Optimize function performances.

**People:** Junwon
**Definition of Done:** Look for ways to make the functions' performances more efficient (ex) reduce memory allocation, speed up functions, etc).
